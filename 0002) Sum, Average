# 1) Write a Program to input 2 numbers and print their sum.

      Program:-
      first = int(input("Enter First element: "))
      second = int(input("Enter Second elements: "))
      print("Sum =", first + second)

      Output:- 
      Enter First element: 5
      Enter Second elements: 8
      Sum = 13
# 2) Write a Program to input two floating point numbers and print their average

      Program:-
      num1 = float(input("Enter First number: "))
      num2 = float(input("Enter Second number: "))
      avg = (num1 + num2) / 2
      print("Average of two numbers: ",avg)

      Output:-
      Enter First number: 4
      Enter Second number: 5
      Average of two numbers:  4.5
